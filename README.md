## Hi, I'm Tyler 👋

**Work:** [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) + [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat)

When I'm not 👨‍💻, I'm probably doing improv 🎭 with [Dollbrick](https://dollbrick.com) or [CSz Seattle](https://cszseattle.com), traveling ✈️ (40+ countries and counting!), or drinking ☕ with the word "mouthfeel" on the packaging and doing some [latte art](https://www.instagram.com/coffeeartbytyler/).
